I made some feeble attempts to get familiar with Github, but finally decided to accept your generous offer of uploading my source code files to it on my behalf.
Sent  herewith are two java source code files. The file names are Maatraa5d and Sandhi5b3m. The first one scans a quarter of Sanskrit verse and outputs the name if the metre is known to it. The second one joins two Sanskrit words as per sandhi rules.
